# Maze-Runner-game
This project is about creating a maze game. By using UNITY software you can build the game. The rotation of the person, the trophy and the blocks for creating a path is done in it. I used C# as main framework for movement of the body. And ShaderLab for some movement of camera according to the person direction.
